# Skin-cancer-classification-using-Pytorch

*Hackathon Bordeaux 2019 - 3rd Prize by Capgemini*: Python implementation of a classification algorithm for cutaneous lesions using a neural network approach.

## Introduction

In this project, i work on the problem of skin lesion classification, particularly early melanoma detection, and present a deep-learning based approach to solve the problem of classifying a dermoscopic image containing a skin lesion as malignant or benign. 

This project is an implentation of the reseach paper **SKIN LESION CLASSIFICATION FROM DERMOSCOPIC IMAGES USING DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES**
The proposed solution is built around the VGGNet convolutional neural network architecture. The neural network is trained on a publicly available skin lesion dermoscopic image dataset (the ISIC Archive dataset). 

The proposed method achieves a sensitivity value of 78.66%, which is significantly higher than the current state of the art on that dataset.
