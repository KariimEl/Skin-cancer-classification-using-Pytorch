# Skin-cancer-classification-using-Pytorch

## Overview

*Hackathon Bordeaux 2019 - 3rd Prize by Capgemini*: Python implementation of a classification algorithm for cutaneous lesions using a neural network approach.

This project is an implentation of the reseach paper **SKIN LESION CLASSIFICATION FROM DERMOSCOPIC IMAGES USING DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES**
The proposed solution is built around the VGGNet convolutional neural network architecture. The neural network is trained on a publicly available skin lesion dermoscopic image dataset (the ISIC Archive dataset). 

The proposed method achieves a sensitivity value of 78.66%, which is significantly higher than the current state of the art on that dataset.

## Introduction


MELANOMA is a fatal form of skin cancer which is often misdiagnosed as a benign skin lesion. An estimated 6,750 deaths of Melanoma each year in the United States. An early detection is imperative and without computer-based assistance, the clinical diagnosis accuracy for melanoma detection is reported to be between 65 and 80%.

The goal of this project is to implement a Skin cancer classification algorithm using Deep Learning to help dermatologists to help them better diagnose their patients.
